## AI Integration

The game supports two AI providers:
- **OpenAI (GPT-3.5-turbo)**: Fast and affordable
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: Alternative AI provider

### Setting Up AI

1. Get an API key from your chosen provider
2. Click "⚙️ AI Settings" in the Chat tab
3. Select your provider and enter your API key
4. Test the connection
5. Adjust creativity slider (0-100) - higher = more unpredictable responses

### How AI Enhances Gameplay

- **Dynamic Dialogue**: NPCs respond naturally to your questions and comments
- **Context Awareness**: NPCs know your level, gold, location, and relationship with them
- **Quest Variations**: Same quest types but with unique twists and descriptions
- **Random Events**: Unexpected occurrences that make each playthrough different
- **Relationship Impact**: NPCs react differently based on how they feel about you

### Without AI

The game works perfectly fine without AI! You'll use traditional button-based interactions with NPCs. AI is an optional enhancement that makes conversations more dynamic and unpredictable.

## Technical Details

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript - no dependencies required
- Runs entirely in your browser - no server needed
- Uses localStorage for save data and AI configuration
- Works offline once loaded (AI features require internet for API calls)
- API keys stored securely in browser localStorage

Enjoy your adventure!
